# Resume-Chatbot
 A custom chatbot that can answer anything about you from your CV!

## About
This project demonstrates the implementation of a personalized CV query system using an open-source model: Qwen 1.5-0.5B-Chat from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat), set up locally. This model was small enough to fit on my GPU. The [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) library by [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/) is employed to orchestrate the LLM (Large Language Model) and apply Retrieve-Augmented-Generation (RAG). By uploading my resume details as a pdf to the LLM, the system can effectively answer any queries related to my CV, showcasing a potentially innovative approach to streamlining employee screenings.

In the near future, this technology could be harnessed by employers to upload and process large volumes of resumes simultaneously. The tool would enable the filtering and sorting of applicants based on their education, experience, skills, and projects, while also providing valuable insights through various statistics and visual representations. This innovation stands to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process.
